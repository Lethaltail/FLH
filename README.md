# FLH
Winbond Voice Editor file extraction with Python. Basically completely written by @luigoalma

Input an FLH file and out will come WAV files with their original filenames.

# Usage
```Usage: FLH.py <.flh file> <destination directory>```

# Known Issues

There is a bug wherein the stock Italian.flh voicepack will not extract due to a difference seemingly unique to that file. There is an issue (#1) that tracks this bug.
